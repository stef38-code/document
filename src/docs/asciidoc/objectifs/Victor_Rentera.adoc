==== Design clean and pragmatic architecture

* [] checkmark Slice and structure your application by Features.
* [] checkmark Group code by the axis of change.
* [] checkmark Organize code in functional top-level packages.
* [] checkmark Find package boundaries (heuristics).
* [] checkmark Remove cyclic dependencies between packages (6 strategies).
* [] checkmark Separate module/compilation units.
* [] checkmark Decouple modules/packages/components with Dependency Inversion.
* [] checkmark Reduce cognitive load with modularity and information hiding.
* [] checkmark Enforce architectural constraints.
* [] checkmark Isolate the core application logic from the infrastructure.
* [] checkmark Test your core logic, infrastructure, and integrations.
* [] checkmark Segregate data structures and DB Schemas.
* [] checkmark Balance between uniformity/standardization and pragmatism.
* [] checkmark Leverage Evolutionary Architecture and avoid big up-front designs.
* [] checkmark Incrementally migrate from legacy Big Ball of Mud to Modulith/Microservices.

==== Design clean services and domain model

* [] checkmark Apply SOLID Principles and Five Rules of Simple Design.
* [] checkmark Masterfully balance coupling and cohesion.
* [] checkmark Make your code speak the domain language.
* [] checkmark Separate the core domain from subdomains.
* [] checkmark Decouple domains with APIs and events.
* [] checkmark Design rich domain entities (OOP done right).
* [] checkmark Protect domain objects’ invariants (strategies).
* [] checkmark Decouple the domain from the infrastructure, API, and persistence.
* [] checkmark Create an Anti-Corruption Layer with Adapter pattern.
* [] checkmark Test-drive the domain with fast unit tests.
* [] checkmark Map the domain to the API DTOs (and stay away from auto-mappers).
* [] checkmark Separate logic by Layers of Abstraction.
* [] checkmark Design Application Services, Controllers, and Façades.
* [] checkmark Logically separate commands from queries with CQRS.
* [] checkmark Improve query performance by using a separate read model.
* [] checkmark Keep write and read models in sync.
